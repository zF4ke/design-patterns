# What is a Design Pattern?

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

# Uses of Design Patterns

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.

In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.

# What I've learned so far

> ## Creational design patterns

> - [Factory Pattern](Creational/Factory.ts)
> - [Singleton Pattern](Creational/Singleton.ts)
> - [Strategy Pattern](Behavioral/Strategy.ts)

# Criticism

- Targets the wrong problem
- Lacks formal foundations
- Leads to inefficient solutions
- Does not differ significantly from other abstractions
